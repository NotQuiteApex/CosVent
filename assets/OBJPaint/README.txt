OBJPaint

This tool was created to make collision stuff, and meant to make it quickly.
Its not a very good tool, you can't edit points once placed, you can't undo its
pretty bad. But it works, so I use it. The file it produces was meant to be
loaded directly with Lua's loadfile() function. This is bad practice.
